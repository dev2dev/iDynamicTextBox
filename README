Introduction:

iDynamicTextBox is a dynamic UITextField implementation for iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) that performs and looks like the native sms text entry box.

The concept was influenced heavily by the methods provided by Hans Pinckaers (http://www.hanspinckaers.com/multi-line-uitextview-similar-to-sms) but written to be a simpler dynamic text field with background image capability.

Usage:

Include the 4 class files and insert the iDynamicTextBox into your view. See the example project for details.
